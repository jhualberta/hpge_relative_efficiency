How to Run GeDet
Geant 4 version 4.9.4.p01 
Installation guide 
http://geant4.slac.stanford.edu/tutorial/installation/Geant4.9.4.p02/Linux/Geant4_9_4_p02_Linux_Installation.htm#_Getting_Geant4
Graphics engine is OpenGL SX


1. Open terminal
2. Go to the working directory of GeDet
2. Run script Configure by:
     $source Configure
		This sets up the enviroment for Geant4 and ROOT
3. Run script RunGeDet by: 
     $ ./RunGeDet
   This will run the simulation

   Inside this script is a line: 
        make && GeDet geom.g4mac run.mac
   which starts simulation with the geaometry file and example of the macro


   To run visualisation - another example macro one can change in the script run.mac to vis.mac.
 
   If the simulation is called with:
    *) 3 arguments like: GeDet [geometry_file] [macro_file] then the data are storred in file OutFile.root
    *) 4 arguments like: GeDet [geometry_file] [macro_file] [output_File.root] then data storred in user defined root file
    *) less than 3 aruments then default arguments are taken (geom.g4mac and run.mac OutFile.root) 
      
   
Particle type, energy, and location can be changed in geant_work/src/GePrimaryGeneratorAction.cc

Geometry of the detector can be modyfied in the geant_work/src/GeDetectorConstruction.cc.  Any new box or tube also needs to be included in geant_work/include/GeDetectorConstruction.hh

Creating new material can be done in geant_work/src/GeDetectorMaterials.icc
